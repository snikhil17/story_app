    **ADVANCED STYLE REFERENCE - USE THIS FOR SOPHISTICATED PROMPTS:**
    You have access to detailed style breakdown data:
    {style_map}
    
    **HOW TO USE STYLE_MAP INTELLIGENTLY:**
    The style_map contains a JSON structure with these key elements:
    - **medium**: Art technique details (e.g., "hand-painted watercolor, traditional animation cel")
    - **lighting**: Specific lighting characteristics (e.g., "soft natural light, dappled sunlight through trees")
    - **colors**: Color palette information (e.g., "muted earth tones, sage greens, sky blues")
    - **details**: Visual detail specifications (e.g., "intricate grass rendering, cumulus cloud formations")
    - **mood**: Emotional atmosphere (e.g., "nostalgic, peaceful, contemplative")
    
    **INTELLIGENT STYLE INTEGRATION EXAMPLES:**
    
    🎨 **Basic Prompt Enhancement:**
    Instead of: "magical forest with warm lighting"
    Use: "magical forest with [extract lighting from style_map], featuring [extract colors from style_map], rendered in [extract medium from style_map], capturing [extract mood from style_map]"
    
    🎨 **Advanced Technical Integration:**
    "TECHNICAL: [extract lighting from style_map], [extract medium from style_map] techniques, [extract details from style_map], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."
    
    🎨 **Environment Enhancement:**
    "ENVIRONMENT: [simple setting] enhanced with [extract colors and mood from style_map], featuring [extract details from style_map]"
    
    **STYLE_MAP EXTRACTION STRATEGY:**
    1. Parse the JSON structure to extract relevant style elements
    2. Use medium details to enhance technical specifications
    3. Apply lighting characteristics to scene descriptions
    4. Integrate color palette into environment descriptions
    5. Weave mood elements into emotional atmosphere
    6. Include artistic details for visual richness
    
    **EXAMPLE STYLE_MAP APPLICATION:**
    If style_map contains ghibli style data:
    - Extract "hand-painted watercolor" → enhance medium description
    - Extract "soft natural light, dappled sunlight" → use for scene lighting
    - Extract "muted earth tones, sage greens" → apply to environment colors
    - Extract "nostalgic, peaceful" → incorporate into emotional mood
    
    **USE STYLE_MAP TO CREATE COHESIVE VISUAL EXPERIENCE:**
    All {image_count} image prompts should consistently reference style_map elements to ensure visual harmony across the entire story. This creates a professional, cohesive look that matches the selected art style perfectly.

    **INTELLIGENT PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**
    You have access to rich personalization data in the plan. Use this intelligently:

    **CHARACTER PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Use the EXACT character descriptions from the plan, especially the main character
    - Apply age-specific visual details (toddler vs child vs pre-teen proportions)
    - Use gender-specific visual cues from character descriptions
    - Include personality traits and clothing style from character descriptions
    - Ensure the main character is prominent and accurately depicted according to plan

    **ENVIRONMENT PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.setting and plan.personalization_elements):**

    **COMPANION INTEGRATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Include companions with their specific descriptions from the plan
    - Position them supportively while keeping main character central
    - Use their defined relationships and interactions from the plan

    **PERFECT IMAGE PROMPT STRUCTURE (Based on Successful Examples):**
    Follow this PROVEN FORMULA for stunning results:

    **CORE FORMULA:**
    "[CAMERA_SHOT] of [MAIN_CHARACTER], [ONE_CLEAR_ACTION] [LOCATION]. CHARACTER: [SIMPLE_APPEARANCE] with [ONE_EMOTION]. ENVIRONMENT: [SIMPLE_SETTING]. COMPANIONS: [COMPANIONS_2_TO_4_MAX]. TECHNICAL: [LIGHTING], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."

    **GOLDEN RULES FOR ENGAGING IMAGES:**
    ✅ **ONE MAIN ACTION**: Child doing ONE clear thing (jumping, building, hugging) - keep child as hero
    ✅ **ENGAGING COMPANIONS**: 2-4 companions maximum for rich storytelling.
    ✅ **FOCUSED ENVIRONMENT**: One main setting that supports the story
    ✅ **CLEAR EMOTION**: One primary emotion with companions supporting it
    ✅ **AGE-APPROPRIATE**: Always mention "age-appropriate [age]-year-old proportions"
    ✅ **CHILD-CENTERED**: Child remains the focal point while companions enhance the scene
    ✅ **CONSISTENT NAMES**: Use same companion names throughout story

    **SMART COMPANION MANAGEMENT:**
    ✅ **2-4 companions**: Perfect for engaging scenes (Baloo + Bagheera + Mowgli)
    ✅ **Clear roles**: Each companion has ONE simple, supportive action
    ✅ **Positioned around child**: Child stays central, companions form supportive circle
    ✅ **Unified emotion**: All characters share similar emotional tone

    **AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
    ❌ Multiple storylines in one image (child building + ants working + grasshopper story)
    ❌ More than 4 companions (causes visual chaos)
    ❌ Companions with competing actions that fight for attention
    ❌ Multiple different emotions or conflicting moods
    ❌ Background elements that tell separate stories
    ❌ Character name inconsistencies

    **CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
    ✅ **Character Accuracy**: Use exact character descriptions from plan.characters, especially main character
    ✅ **Age Precision**: Include age-appropriate proportions and features from character descriptions
    ✅ **Gender Consistency**: Apply correct visual gender cues from character descriptions
    ✅ **Cultural Authenticity**: Include setting and cultural elements from plan.setting
    ✅ **Interest Integration**: Include environment elements from plan.personalization_elements
    ✅ **Companion Placement**: Include companions with their specific roles and descriptions from plan
    ✅ **Emotional Context**: Reflect the chapter's emotional tone and specific action

    **INTELLIGENT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
    - From plan.characters: Extract main character's physical description, age features, personality traits
    - From plan.setting: Extract cultural details, location specifics, authentic environmental elements
    - From plan.personalization_elements: Extract interest-based props, environmental modifications
    - From chapter content: Extract specific actions, emotions, scene context for that image

    **Example of intelligent personalization application:**
    Instead of generic "a young child", use: "Aadhvita, an 8-year-old girl with curious dark eyes and shoulder-length black hair in pigtails, wearing a colorful school uniform with mathematical symbols on her accessories, showing confident problem-solving expression"

    **COMPOSITION AND LAYOUT:**

    Follow this structure for every image prompt:
    1. **Child-Centered Action**: One clear activity the child is doing
    2. **Supportive Companions**: 2-4 friends sharing the same emotional moment
    3. **Unified Scene**: Everyone participates in the child's story
    4. **Simple Environment**: One clear setting that supports the action
    5. **Consistent Technical Format**: Always end with the same technical specifications

    **EXAMPLE FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {{
      "formatted_story": {{
        "title": "[Engaging title with {child_name}]",

TECHNICAL: [lighting], style is cartoony, cute, watercolor-like, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."
      ]
    }}
    ```

    **CRITICAL IMAGE QUALITY CHECKLIST:**
    Before finalizing each image prompt, verify:
    ☐ ONE main character action (child-focused)
    ☐ ONE clear primary emotion
    ☐ ONE primary setting/environment
    ☐ 2-4 companions maximum (engaging but not overwhelming)
    ☐ Age-appropriate proportions mentioned
    ☐ 16:9 aspect ratio specified
    ☐ Style: cartoony, cute, watercolor-like
    ☐ Child stays as focal point with companions supporting

    **ENGAGING SCENE PATTERNS:**
    ✅ **Group Celebration**: Child + companions all celebrating together
    ✅ **Learning Circle**: Child teaching + companions watching/learning
    ✅ **Adventure Team**: Child leading + companions supporting
    ✅ **Problem Solving**: Child figuring out + companions encouraging
    ✅ **Playtime Fun**: Child playing + companions joining same activity

    **AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
    ❌ Multiple separate storylines in one image
    ❌ More than 4 companions (causes visual chaos)
    ❌ Companions doing completely different activities
    ❌ Character name inconsistencies
    ❌ Background elements telling separate stories

    **GUARANTEED SUCCESS FORMULA:**
    "[Camera shot] of [Child name], a [age description], [ONE MAIN ACTION] in [SIMPLE LOCATION]. CHARACTER: [Child] has [ONE EMOTION] with age-appropriate [age]-year-old proportions.

TECHNICAL: [lighting], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."

    **KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:**
    - Each image focuses on ONE clear moment
    - Simple, supportive environment  
    - Clear character emotions and actions
    - Minimal but meaningful companion interaction
    - Consistent style and technical specifications

#     2. **Cultural Touch**: Include ONE authentic detail from {region} (food, greeting, or landmark)
#     3. **Sensory Anchor**: Each section needs ONE unique sense (Section 1: sound, Section 2: touch, Section 3: sight)
#     4. **The Mirror Moment**: {child_name} must see themselves in another character's struggle
#     5. **The Echo Ending**: Last sentence echoes the first with transformation

    **CHARACTER PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Use the EXACT character descriptions from the plan, especially the main character
    - Apply age-specific visual details (toddler vs child vs pre-teen proportions)
    - Use gender-specific visual cues from character descriptions
    - Include personality traits and clothing style from character descriptions

    - Position them supportively while keeping main character central
    - Use their defined relationships and interactions from the plan

    **PERFECT IMAGE PROMPT STRUCTURE (Based on Successful Examples):**
    Follow this PROVEN FORMULA for stunning results:

    **CORE FORMULA:**
    "[CAMERA_SHOT] of [MAIN_CHARACTER], [ONE_CLEAR_ACTION] [LOCATION]. CHARACTER: [SIMPLE_APPEARANCE] with [ONE_EMOTION]. ENVIRONMENT: [SIMPLE_SETTING]. COMPANIONS: [COMPANIONS_2_TO_4_MAX]. TECHNICAL: [LIGHTING], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."

    **GOLDEN RULES FOR ENGAGING IMAGES:**
    ✅ **ONE MAIN ACTION**: Child doing ONE clear thing (jumping, building, hugging) - keep child as hero
    ✅ **ENGAGING COMPANIONS**: 2-4 companions maximum for rich storytelling.
    ✅ **FOCUSED ENVIRONMENT**: One main setting that supports the story
    ✅ **CLEAR EMOTION**: One primary emotion with companions supporting it
    ✅ **AGE-APPROPRIATE**: Always mention "age-appropriate [age]-year-old proportions"
    ✅ **CHILD-CENTERED**: Child remains the focal point while companions enhance the scene
    ✅ **CONSISTENT NAMES**: Use same companion names throughout story

    **SMART COMPANION MANAGEMENT:**
    ✅ **2-4 companions**: Perfect for engaging scenes (Baloo + Bagheera + Mowgli)
    ✅ **Clear roles**: Each companion has ONE simple, supportive action
    ✅ **Positioned around child**: Child stays central, companions form supportive circle
    ✅ **Unified emotion**: All characters share similar emotional tone

    **AVOID THESE MISTAKES:**
    ❌ Multiple storylines in one image (child building + ants working + grasshopper story)
    ❌ More than 4 companions (causes visual chaos)
    ❌ Companions with competing actions that fight for attention
    ❌ Multiple different emotions or conflicting moods
    ❌ Background elements that tell separate stories
    ❌ Character name inconsistencies

    **CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
    ✅ **Character Accuracy**: Use exact character descriptions from plan.characters, especially main character
    ✅ **Age Precision**: Include age-appropriate proportions and features from character descriptions
    ✅ **Gender Consistency**: Apply correct visual gender cues from character descriptions
    ✅ **Cultural Authenticity**: Include setting and cultural elements from plan.setting
    ✅ **Interest Integration**: Include environment elements from plan.personalization_elements
    ✅ **Companion Placement**: Include companions with their specific roles and descriptions from plan
    ✅ **Emotional Context**: Reflect the chapter's emotional tone and specific action

    **INTELLIGENT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
    - From plan.characters: Extract main character's physical description, age features, personality traits
    - From plan.setting: Extract cultural details, location specifics, authentic environmental elements
    - From plan.personalization_elements: Extract interest-based props, environmental modifications
    - From chapter content: Extract specific actions, emotions, scene context for that image

    **Example of intelligent personalization application:**
    Instead of generic "a young child", use: "Aadhvita, an 8-year-old girl with curious dark eyes and shoulder-length black hair in pigtails, wearing a colorful school uniform with mathematical symbols on her accessories, showing confident problem-solving expression"

    **COMPOSITION AND LAYOUT:**
    - Create images with {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio for optimal display
    - Follow this composition guide: {composition_guide}
    - Ensure the main subject is centered and fills the frame appropriately
    - Leave adequate space around the subject to prevent cropping issues
    - Design the composition to be responsive and viewable at different sizes
