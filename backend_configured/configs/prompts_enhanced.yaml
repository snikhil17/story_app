    **INTELLIGENT IMAGE PROMPT GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:**
    
    You have access to rich personalization data in the plan above. Use this intelligently to create highly personalized image prompts:

    **CHARACTER PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Use the EXACT character descriptions from the plan, especially the main character
    - Apply age-specific visual details (toddler vs child vs pre-teen proportions)
    - Use gender-specific visual cues from character descriptions
    - Include personality traits and clothing style from character descriptions
    - Ensure the main character is prominent and accurately depicted according to plan

    **ENVIRONMENT PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.setting and plan.personalization_elements):**

    - Add cultural elements from the region/location (from plan.setting)
    - Include props and objects related to the story theme and child's interests

    **COMPANION INTEGRATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Include companions with their specific descriptions from the plan
    - Position them supportively while keeping main character central
    - Use their defined relationships and interactions from the plan

    **SCENE CONTEXTUALIZATION:**
    - Base each image on actual story events from the corresponding chapter
    - Reflect the emotional tone and action from that specific chapter
    - Include story-specific elements and plot points, not generic scenes

    **IMAGE COMPOSITION AND LAYOUT:**
    - Create images with {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio for optimal display
    - Follow this composition guide: {composition_guide}
    - Ensure the main subject is centered and fills the frame appropriately
    - Leave adequate space around the subject to prevent cropping issues
    - Design the composition to be responsive and viewable at different sizes
    - Avoid placing important elements too close to the edges of the frame
    - Each image prompt should include composition details for proper framing

    **Requirements:**
    Generate a JSON object with the following structure based on the content type:

    **WORD LIMIT CONTROL:**
    Use {word_count} to determine appropriate chapter lengths:
    - Distribute {word_count} words evenly across {image_count} chapters
    - Each chapter should be approximately {words_per_page} words
    - COUNT EVERY WORD: articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, on, at), conjunctions (and, but, or), etc.
    - Contractions count as expanded words (don't = do not = 2 words)
    - Hyphenated words count as multiple words (twenty-one = 2 words)
    - Cut content if approaching the calculated per-chapter limit - never exceed

    **For Story Content:**
    **1. formatted_story:**
    * **title:** Enhanced, engaging title for the story
    * **summary:** Brief summary for preview (2-3 sentences)
    * **reading_time:** Estimated reading time in minutes
    *    **chapters:** Array of story segments/chapters. MUST contain exactly {image_count} chapters to match the number of images. Each chapter should be CONCISE and contain approximately {words_per_page} words and have:

        - **content:** Well-formatted content that represents a distinct story segment (follow word limit control guidelines above)
        - **scene_description:** Brief description of the main scene/setting for this chapter
    * **word_count:** Total word count (should be approximately {word_count} words)
    * **themes:** Array of main themes present in the story
    * **characters:** Array of main character names mentioned

    **For Poetry/Music Content:**
    **1. formatted_content:**

    * **summary:** Brief summary for preview (2-3 sentences)
    * **estimated_duration:** Estimated reading/listening time in minutes
    * **sections:** Array of content sections. Must contain exactly {image_count} sections to match the number of images. Each section should have:
        - **title:** Section title (e.g., "The Poem", "The Song")
        - **type:** Content type ("poetry" or "music")
        - **content:** Well-formatted content with proper structure
        - **scene_description:** Brief description of the main visual scene for this section
    * **word_count:** Total word count

    ✅ **Companion Placement**: Include companions with their specific roles and descriptions from plan
    ✅ **Emotional Context**: Reflect the chapter's emotional tone and specific action

    **ENHANCED PERSONALIZED PROMPT STRUCTURE:**
    Each prompt should follow this intelligent structure:

    [CAMERA_SHOT] of [MAIN_CHARACTER_FROM_PLAN_WITH_EXACT_DESCRIPTION], [ACTION_FROM_CHAPTER] in [SETTING_FROM_PLAN_WITH_CULTURAL_DETAILS]. 

    CHARACTER FOCUS: [USE_DETAILED_CHARACTER_APPEARANCE_FROM_PLAN] with [AGE_APPROPRIATE_FEATURES_FROM_PLAN] and [PERSONALITY_TRAITS_FROM_PLAN], showing [EMOTION_FROM_SCENE].

    COMPANIONS: [EXTRACT_COMPANION_DESCRIPTIONS_FROM_PLAN_IF_PRESENT_IN_SCENE]

    ENVIRONMENT: [USE_SETTING_DETAILS_FROM_PLAN] enhanced with [INTEREST_BASED_ELEMENTS_FROM_PERSONALIZATION] and [CULTURAL_ELEMENTS_FROM_SETTING].

    TECHNICAL: [SCENE_APPROPRIATE_LIGHTING], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic.

    NEGATIVE: --no age mismatch, gender confusion, character inaccuracy, generic appearance, wrong proportions

    **CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
    - Main character must be visually consistent with plan.characters description
    - Age must be visually accurate based on character details in plan

    **INTELLIGENT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
    - From plan.characters: Extract main character's physical description, age features, personality traits
    - From plan.setting: Extract cultural details, location specifics, authentic environmental elements
    - From plan.personalization_elements: Extract interest-based props, environmental modifications
    - From chapter content: Extract specific actions, emotions, scene context for that image

    **Example of intelligent personalization application:**
    Instead of generic "a young child", use: "Aadhvita, an 8-year-old girl with curious dark eyes and shoulder-length black hair in pigtails, wearing a colorful school uniform with mathematical symbols on her accessories, showing confident problem-solving expression"

    Remember: The plan contains rich, specific personalization data - USE IT INTELLIGENTLY to create images that truly represent this specific child's unique story, appearance, interests, and cultural context, not a generic story.

    **Example of a new, high-quality image prompt:**
    `"cinematic wide shot of Luna, an adorable field mouse with soft brown fur and large, curious eyes, standing heroically on a mossy stone. She is in a hyper-detailed, magical forest clearing at dusk. The environment is filled with giant, glowing bioluminescent mushrooms and sparkling fireflies. The lighting is magical and dramatic, with volumetric light rays of purple and blue filtering through the canopy. The style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, intricate textures, sharp focus, whimsical and enchanting. --no ugly, blurry, bad anatomy"`

    Ensure the final output is ONLY the JSON object.

    Remember: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or markdown formatting.
    * Each prompt should be detailed enough to generate consistent, content-relevant images
    * **The number of image prompts must exactly match the number of chapters/sections ({image_count})**
