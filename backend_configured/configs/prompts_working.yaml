    Instead of generic "a young child", use: "Aadhvita, an 8-year-old girl with curious dark eyes and shoulder-length black hair in pigtails, wearing a colorful school uniform with mathematical symbols on her accessories, showing confident problem-solving expression"

    Remember: The plan contains rich, specific personalization data - USE IT INTELLIGENTLY to create images that truly represent this specific child's unique story, appearance, interests, and cultural context, not a generic story.

    **Example of a new, high-quality image prompt:**
    `"cinematic wide shot of Luna, an adorable field mouse with soft brown fur and large, curious eyes, standing heroically on a mossy stone. She is in a hyper-detailed, magical forest clearing at dusk. The environment is filled with giant, glowing bioluminescent mushrooms and sparkling fireflies.
