    STORY BRIEF:
    - Request: "{user_input}"
    - Length: {word_count} words total ({words_per_page} per section)
    - Sections: {image_count}
    - Language: {language_of_story}

    PERSONALIZATION:
    - Child: {child_name}, {child_age} years old
    - Interests: {interests}
    - Location: {location}, {region}
    - Cultural Context: {plan}

    === PHASE 1: STORY CREATION ===

    Write an engaging {content_type} following this structure:

    FOR STORIES:
    1. **Hook** (First section): Start with action or intrigue
    2. **Build** (Middle sections): Develop conflict/challenge
    3. **Resolve** (Final section): Satisfying conclusion with growth

    FOR EDUCATIONAL:
    1. **Discover**: Introduce concept through exploration
    2. **Understand**: Build knowledge through examples
    3. **Apply**: Use knowledge to solve problems

    WRITING GUIDELINES:
    - Write naturally in {language_of_story}
    - Use age-appropriate vocabulary for {age_group}
    - Include sensory details (what they see, hear, feel)
    - Create emotional moments children connect with
    - Integrate {interests} as natural story elements
    - Add cultural details from {region} authentically

    WORD COUNT:
    - Aim for ~{words_per_page} words per section
    - Total must be close to {word_count}
    - Natural storytelling matters more than exact counts

    === PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT IMAGE PROMPT GENERATION ===

    Create {image_count} HIGHLY PERSONALIZED, master-level image prompts using LAYERED TECHNIQUE and intelligent extraction from the plan.

    **DETAILED STYLE REFERENCE:**
    Use this detailed style information to create sophisticated, consistent image prompts:
    {style_map}
    
    The style_map provides:
    - medium: Art medium and technique details
    - lighting: Specific lighting characteristics
    - colors: Color palette and tone information  
    - details: Artistic detail specifications
    - mood: Emotional and atmospheric qualities
    
    Extract these elements and weave them naturally into your image prompts for enhanced visual consistency and quality.

    **INTELLIGENT PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**
    You have access to rich personalization data in the plan. Use this intelligently:

    **CHARACTER PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.characters array):**
    - Use the EXACT character descriptions from the plan, especially the main character
    - Apply age-specific visual details (toddler vs child vs pre-teen proportions)
    - Use gender-specific visual cues from character descriptions
    - Include personality traits and clothing style from character descriptions
    - Ensure the main character is prominent and accurately depicted according to plan

    **ENVIRONMENT PERSONALIZATION (Extract from plan.setting and plan.personalization_elements):**
    - Use the detailed setting description for authentic backgrounds
    - Include interest-based environmental elements (from plan.personalization_elements)
    - Add cultural elements from the region/location (from plan.setting)
    - Include props and objects related to the story theme and child's interests

    **CORE FORMULA WITH STYLE INTEGRATION:**
    "[CAMERA_SHOT] of [MAIN_CHARACTER], [ONE_CLEAR_ACTION] [LOCATION]. CHARACTER: [SIMPLE_APPEARANCE] with [ONE_EMOTION]. ENVIRONMENT: [SIMPLE_SETTING with style_map.colors and style_map.details]. LIGHTING: [style_map.lighting]. TECHNICAL: [style_map.medium], style is {aesthetic}, digital painting, masterpiece, ultra-detailed, character-focused composition, age-accurate proportions, sharp focus, personalized and authentic, 16:9 aspect ratio."

    **EXAMPLE OF STYLE_MAP INTEGRATION:**
    Instead of: "magical forest with warm lighting"
    Use: "magical forest with {style_map.lighting} (e.g., 'soft natural light, dappled sunlight through trees'), featuring {style_map.colors} palette (e.g., 'muted earth tones, sage greens, sky blues'), rendered in {style_map.medium} (e.g., 'hand-painted watercolor, traditional animation cel'), capturing {style_map.mood} (e.g., 'nostalgic, peaceful, contemplative')"

    === OUTPUT FORMAT ===

    {{
      "formatted_story": {{
        "title": "[Engaging title with {child_name}]",
        "summary": "[One exciting sentence about the adventure]",
        "reading_time": [number],
